# Cybersecurity: Theory, Tools - L1

## About Me
I am a Computer Science student at Habib University with a strong foundation in operating systems, system design, programming, and research-driven technical projects. My academic experience includes operating systems lab development, database systems, graph data science, and applied software engineering. I am particularly interested in system-level security and secure software practices.

## About This Repository
This repository documents my structured learning and hands-on practice for the course Cybersecurity: Theory, Tools - L1. It serves as a technical log of experiments, labs, and security-focused exercises that build practical understanding alongside theoretical foundations.

## Cybersecurity Focus Areas
- Networking fundamentals and protocol analysis  
- Linux system security and permissions management  
- Access control models and authentication mechanisms  
- Threat modeling and attack surface analysis  
- Basic vulnerability assessment concepts  
- Secure coding principles  
- Bash and Python scripting for security tasks  
- Hands-on use of security tools in lab environments  

## Objective
To strengthen my understanding of defensive security, system hardening, and vulnerability analysis while building practical skills applicable to real-world cybersecurity engineering.
